# 6: Permutations

[Inspired by this Leetcode question.](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

Problem:

Given an array of integers, return all possible configurations that the original array can be in.

For example, given [1,2,3].
-> [ [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,3,1], [2,1,3], [3,2,1] ]

Use recursion in your solution.
