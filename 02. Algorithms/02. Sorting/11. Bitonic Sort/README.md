[Bitonic Sort Video Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEfieI0MumY)


-Bitonic sort does O(n Log 2n) comparisons.

-The number of comparisons done by Bitonic sort are more than popular sorting algorithms like Merge Sort [ does O(nLogn) comparisons], but Bitonice sort is better for parallel implementation because we always compare elements in predefined sequence and the sequence of comparison doesnâ€™t depend on data. Therefore it is suitable for implementation in hardware and parallel processor array.

-Bitonic Sort must be done if number of elements to sort are 2^n. The procedure of bitonic sequence fails if the number of elements are not in the aforementioned quantity precisely.
